# Complete TODO App API

This was the biggest project made during the course and I learned a lot about what to expect a complete (although small scale) 
project to look like.
There is no frontend interface, I used Postman to call the API.

## What I learned

- Express advanced concepts like Middlewares
- Authentication with JWT
- Lots of testing
- Postman features like environment, variables, projects and more
- How a NoSQL database works, mongoose orm
- Heroku deployment
